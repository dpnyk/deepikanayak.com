## Challenges

With a lot of wallet apps, payment has become much easier than it used to be however till date peer to peer payment via a mobile app has not been explored, understanding how this can be cracked and creating the information architecture and interactions in a way that the user not only feels comfortable but also secure was the key challenge.


## Process

Security is always a big concern for most people when it comes to electronically dealing with money. Our research indicated that the users wanted something that was very simple yet secure in order to be able to trust money transfers. We did extensive research in understanding the psychology of users when money handling was done, based on this our IA was constructed in a way that it considered scenarios where the phone may be misplaced or lost as well. Interactions were such that we ensured the user was constantly aware of what exactly was happening by giving appropriate feedback messages and cues to help the user understand the features. Language and tone used were also simple and easy to understand. Psychology of colour was explored in order to give it hues that created trust subconsciously. A simple clean layout was our preference and we worked towards the same.

## Learnings
Designing for security, we came across challenges that are not usually seen. We were constantly putting ourselves in the userâ€™s brains to see what would make them comfortable and re-iterating the process to refine and deliver a clean and simple layout for our users. This taught me how to design for simplicity over fancy transitions and effects we constantly use to create an extra delight for the user.
