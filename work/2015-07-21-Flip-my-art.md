## Challenges

One of the biggest challenge we had to tackle was to build a platform for two very different kind of users and still make it intuitive and easy enough for both of them. The platform needed to be appealing, easy to use and showcase artwork for artists while not intimidating the buyer with too much at the same time. 

- Understanding where student artists come from, what are their main goals from the platform would be. Mostly artists or buyers are not very keen on revealing themselves and their patterns, working to help them ease up and openly converse about their lifestyle, their habits was challenging.
- Working on the perception that people have towards art buying and analysing how we could clear the misconceptions and help the users to invest and encourage young artists 
- Innovating new ways of showcasing artwork in a gallery like setting to help artists
- Understanding the needs of the potential buyers as to present the artwork in ways that would help them be more confident of their purchase ( view in different room settings, compare in room settings)
- Reducing distractions - This has been one of the most common problems in an e-commerce store, keeping the checkout process simple and the forms designed to quickly and easily enter data was a challenge


## Process

 I started out with identifying and defining our target market. After this I separated our users into two groups, Art Sellers and Art buyers. Once we had identified our target I started off with our user research, with a combination of user interviews, online and offline surveys, focus groups, I was able to observe and record the behavioural and temperamental patterns of artists, preferences and habits, expectations and goals in a systematic manner. Once this was done, I did a similar interview process for art buyers, their expectations, what inhibits them. With the data collected, common patterns were identified and character sketches made. Based on these, personas were created. Once we had a solid understanding of our users, We began to look at the problems they faced and solutions we could provide. Some of the unique solutions we implemented were,
 
 - Ability for the artist to use a virtual gallery setting to showcase their artwork
- Flip as a brand was incorporated in features such as a scrapbook which would flip. The scrapbook is for artists to show more about themselves, like inspirations, their favourite quotes etc. This helps connect the artist to the buyer and make the transaction more personal as art usually is a very personal purchase.
- View in different settings for the buyer to be able to compare settings 
Compare artwork in the same setting
- Easy and distraction less Checkout
- Completion meter  to help encourage the artists to fill out more details


Constant user tests were conducted at every level to ensure that we are designing for our users

## Learnings
The biggest learning was to understand the requirements of artists and buyers fulfilling them, testing constantly to see if what we have designed is intuitive and natural to the users.
