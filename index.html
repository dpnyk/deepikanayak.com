        <h3>About Me</h3>

<p>Hello, I am an artist, designer, analyst and a budding front end developer.</p>


<h3>Design</h3>

<p> I believe good, clean and minimal designs that provide a seamless experience is not optional anymore. Design is a part of our everyday lives and every design has a story behind it. I like to create great designs and explore existing ones and find ways to make them more efficient and better. </p>

<h3>Hand-Lettering</h3>

<p>My tryst with hand-lettering began during college as doodles in my book during boring lectures. In my free time I like to work on beautiful typefaces and have started making handlettered posters like this</p>

<h3>Front End Development</h3>

<p>From creating designs, I now plan to take one step ahead and build them myself which is why I have picked up some skills in Front End Development. My journey here has just begun and I am looking to see exciting times ahead.</p>
